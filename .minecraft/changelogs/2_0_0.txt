New Multiblocks:
	Added two new high tier generators (Luv and ZPM) these are loot only schematics found on Euclydes and Aurellia. They can burn infused diesel or naquadriatic fuel to produce vast amounts of GT Energy. 

Fuel:
	Added a new high end fuel called naquadriatic fuel that uses refined naquadah as well as the top tier infused diesel to create the most energy dense fuel available in the pack. This fuel works in both Naquadah generators as well as diesel generators and the new multiblock ZPM/LUV Diesel gens

Ore Multiplication:
	The old process of using chickens and blood altars etc has been completely removed and revamped. You can now process your ores up to an insane 64x multiplier if you run them through the entire process. Added a new questline outlining the steps. Ore multiplication no longer involves chickens as we were simply getting 	far too many complaints from PETA.
