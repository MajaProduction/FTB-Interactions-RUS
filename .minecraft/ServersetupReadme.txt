if you want to run a sever you'll need to install the current version of forge for your server (forge-14.23.5.2847)


1. Make sure level-type=voidworld in the server.properties, this will enable initial island generation as well as island control commands and then delete your world and regenerate a new one.
	If you started your world before setting this make sure to shutdown, delete the world folder and restart after setting this.
2. If you want to advertise your server we recommend https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeastservers and https://forum.feed-the-beast.com/servers/

The initial island will be spawn for everyone, it is not recommended you base here but rather build a decorative communal hub that everyone can return to with the
/spawn command.

Each new player should do /island create to get their own island and /island home to return to that island at any time. Friends can invite/join to their island once created
with the /island invite and /island join commands.

Feel free to add any addition mods for maintaining your server. Our servers are compatible with Chunk Pregenerator Mod and if 
you elect to pregenerate your world the recommended dimensions are 100, 145, 146 and 147

If you have any questions ask in our discord or issue tracker.
